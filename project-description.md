# Research Project Management System

## Project Overview
A full-stack web application designed to streamline the research project management process. The system facilitates user authentication, research gap analysis, and efficient project organization through a modern, responsive interface.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Core server framework providing robust API endpoints and middleware support
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible data storage and retrieval
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, enabling schema-based data modeling
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens with refresh token mechanism
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Cloud storage solution for managing research documents and user data
- **Bcrypt**: Password hashing for enhanced security

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern, responsive user interface
- **JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity and API integration
- **Local Storage**: Client-side token management
